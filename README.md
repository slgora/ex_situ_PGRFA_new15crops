# REPOSITORY FOR EX SITU PGRFA METRICS: `new15crops`

This fork extends the original methodology from the first 15 crops for computing ex situ conservation metrics of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA), with a focused analysis on a subset of new 15 priority crops. It introduces modular scripts, reproducible workflows, and outputs tailored to crop-specific conservation insights.

## Purpose

To generate and refine conservation metrics for a targeted crop subset using harmonized data from Genesys, WIEWS, BGCI, GLIS, and SGSV. This fork supports:
- Crop-specific metric computation for new 15 crops
- Enhanced reproducibility and documentation
- Modular outputs for reporting and review

## Workflow Overview

**0. Downloading Data**  
- Sources: Genesys, WIEWS, BGCI, GLIS (via API), SGSV

**1. Loading and Merging Datasets**  

**2. Standardizing Taxa**  
- Curated taxon list for 15 crops  
- MCPD-compliant naming conventions

**3. Post-Standardization Processing** 

**4. Computing Metrics**  
  
**5. Processing Plants That Feed the World Data**  
- Integrated with crop subset  
- Relevant metric computation

**6. Producing Tables**  
- Modular summary tables  
- Excel-compatible outputs     

## Standards and Documentation

- Column names and values follow the MCPD standard:

- All scripts are annotated for clarity and reproducibility
- GitHub branching strategy ensures modular development and version control
