#' Generate Table 4: Crop‐Specific Metrics Summary
#'
#' Constructs Table 4 for each crop strategy, summarizing key metrics across:
#' - Genebank holdings (international and national)
#' - Annex I inclusion
#' - GLIS DOI and MLS notifications
#' - MLS status in international and national collections, including missing MLS info
#'
#' The function uses a mapping guide to dynamically link metrics, applies conditional filters
#' (e.g., `A15_collection`), and aggregates values where needed.
#' Percentages are recalculated from totals when required, and all outputs are formatted for reporting:
#' - Numbers are comma-formatted if >=1,000
#' - Percentages are rounded to one decimal place with a "%" symbol
#'
#' @param metrics_guide A data frame containing metadata for metric mapping.
#'   Must include columns:
#'   - `Pertains to Table`
#'   - `Metric Name in Results Table (or summaries text)`
#'   - `Metric Role` ("Number" or "Percentage")
#'
#' @param metric_dfs A named list of data frames, each containing a `Crop_strategy` column.
#'   Expected names and columns:
#'   - `accessions_by_org_type`: n_records, percent, A15_collection
#'   - `annex1_count`: count_includedannex1
#'   - `annex1_perc`: annex1_perc
#'   - `GLIS_dois_count`: dois
#'   - `GLIS_MLS_count`: MLS_notified
#'   - `mls_by_orgtype`: count_includedmls, count_notincludedmls, count_noMLSinformation,
#'     percent_includedmls, percent_notincludedmls, percent_noMLSinformation, total_crop_records, A15_collection
#'
#' @return A named list of tibbles, one per crop strategy, each with columns:
#'   - Metric
#'   - Number (character, formatted)
#'   - Percentage (character, formatted with %)
#'
